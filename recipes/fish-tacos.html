      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 ½ pounds cod fillets, cubed</li>
      <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>

    <ol>
      <li>In a shallow bowl, whisk together beer, flour, and salt.</li>
      <li>Rinse fish, and pat dry. Cut into 10 equal pieces.</li>
      <li>
        In a large saucepan, heat 1 inch oil to 360 degrees F (168 degrees C).
        Using a fork, coat fish pieces in batter. Slide coated fish into hot oil
        in batches; adjust heat to maintain oil temperature. Fry until golden,
        about 2 minutes. Lift out with a slotted spoon, and drain briefly on
        paper towels; keep warm. Repeat to fry remaining fish.
