      <li>4 drops Worcestershire sauce, or to taste</li>
      <li>3 pinches garlic powder</li>
      <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>kosher salt to taste</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Divide beef into two 3-ounce balls. Lightly moisten fingertips with
        water and press beef into patties about 1/4-inch thick. Drop
        Worcestershire sauce over patties; rub in lightly. Sprinkle garlic
        powder, black pepper, salt, and cayenne on top and rub in.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut a circle of cheese using a pastry cutter or the rim of a glass.
        Place cheese onto 1 patty; cover with the other patty. Press edges
        together carefully. Flip and continue pressing until fully sealed.
        Season both sides with a little salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Cook patty for 5 minutes
        per side for medium doneness. Place patty on one half of a bun. Top with
        tomato, lettuce, and the other half of the bun.
      </li>
    </ol>
